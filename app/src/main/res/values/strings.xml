    <string name="Bio"> Hi, my nane is Aleks.
        \n\n I love fish.
        \n\n The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquariumor river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean
        \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \n\nI Like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish poached fish - not so much
        \n And sometimes I even go fishing.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
        n\n0nce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught aq large salmon with my hands
        \n\n I\'lL be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \nYou should ask soneone else about fishing, though. \n\n</string>
